# [openlectures Verethragna](http://openlectures.org)

Named after the Zoroastrian/Persian God of Victory - specifically the smiting of resistance - this repository tracks the bleeding-edge build for the openlectures web client and back-end.

## Introduction

Verethragna manages and displays lectures in accordance with openlectures production guidelines and specifications. The database is bidirectionally synchronized to Google Drive. Subsequent updates will allow advanced user-tracking and extensive third-party API integration

The live (shipped) version of the site can be found at http://openlectures.org.

The production version of the site can be found at http://ol2.herokuapp.com.

## Quick Start

Fork and Clone this repository to a local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jethrokuan/ol2.git
```

Run ``bundle update`` to install all gems and rails dependencies. This pulls information from the ``ol2`` gemset.

Run ``vendorer update`` to update all vendor CSS and JS dependencies. This pulls information from ``Vendorfile``. Damn have we made it easy for you.

Migrate the database and seed:

```bash
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

Initialize the server instance by running:

```bash
rails s
```

If you prefer the full rackware experience, run ``thin start``. And if you happen to be one of those test-driven monkeys, ``zeus start`` followed by ``zeus s`` will give you all the cucumbers you need.

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to browse the site. Live long and prosper.

## Core Dependencies

+ [Ruby 1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
+ [Rails 3.2](http://rubyonrails.org/)
+ [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
+ [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
+ [Elbow Grease](http://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0)

## Easy Installation

If you already have Ruby on Rails and all the related core dependencies on your system, just upgrade everything to the latest stable build by running:

```bash
sudo gem update --system
gem update
```

If this throws an error (i.e. it gives you something that doesn't look nice or cute), you should do a fresh install

```bash
curl -O https://raw.github.com/joshfng/railsready/master/railsready.sh && bash railsready.sh
```

Have a coffee and feel the magic.

## Real Man's Installation (From Zero to Hero)

**OS X**

Install Homebrew

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
```

Install XCode from the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12). If you want to keep things lean, install only the command-line tools (Preferences > Downloads > Components). If you feel like proving your ultimate worth, find out how to install GCC.

Install Ruby Version Manager (RVM), Ruby and Rails in one fell swoop

```bash
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby --rails
```

## Versioning

Development will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible in order to ensure transparency and backwards compatibility.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

+ Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
+ New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and resets the patch)
+ Bug fixes and miscellaneous changes bump the patch

## Changelog

We make it a habit to write Version History like Bryan Jones of [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

**v1.0.0 (Bouncing Banana)**

+ Verethragna was born (Presumptuous of us, we know)
+ Uses Twitter Bootstrap with good cover and concealment, because everyone does. We just use it the way it was actually meant to be used.
+ Implements User Authentication and Authorization. One of those login thingamajigs.
+ Provides a basic CMS for creating, editing and deleting syllabuses, subjects, topics, lessons, checkpoints, question/answer pairs and summaries
+ Dumps a copy of any database actions to Google Drive (Create/Destroy/Edit) and allows the user to pull an update from there

## Roadmap

+ Upgrade to Ruby 2.0, Rails 4, Backbone, Grape, and all those things modern people create for post-modern people.
+ Use Ratchet for a mobile UI that isn't just scaled-down text and rearranged page elements (because Flexbox sucks so bad).
+ Identify users by school and dish out proper customized content.
+ A/B Testing because we can, and because everyone does it. We're bandwagon sluts, we know.
